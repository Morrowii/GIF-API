# GIF-API

A simple Giphy API that was developed to practice and demonstrate my skills, and hopefully provide a little fun too!

Search and add tags to the GIF button tray, then click a GIF tag button to generate relevant images.

Click on an image to play the GIF. When the GIF is playing, click on it again to stop the GIF.

A rating is displayed below each GIF.
